its like normal and and or condition logically,
it is used to use multiple where clauses at a time if needed 

eg:-
SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NAME='PREETHI' AND REG_NO=121;
here both the condition should be satisfied then only it will be printed .
SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE NAME='PREETHI' OR REG_NO=121;
here if any one condition satisfied also its gona be printing the result.
SELECT NAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE (NAME='PREETHI'AND REG_NO=121) OR (HOUR>5);

be careful while choosing paranthesis to put .
