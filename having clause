which and having clause are same doing functionalities whichnwill minimize the rows and shows the datas but in having it is used inside
group by clause inside filtration by group by then it will again filterize the datas .its the basic definition 


logically lets see an example 

if i wanted to retrive the names and their salaries only from specific city and then in that city who are earning more than 5000
should be displayed
SELECT NAME,SALARY,CITY FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY CITY,NAME, SALARY HAVING SALARY>5000;
SELECT NAME ,SUM(HOUR) FROM EMPLOYEE GROUP BY CITY HAVING SUM(HOUR)>5;
